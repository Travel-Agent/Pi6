qList - Awesome Keyboard Shortcuts Chrome Extension
===========

qList adds keyboard-shortcuts to **sites based on lists and search**.

The heck does that mean?
For example, google search is just searching something and going to another link.
*Guess what?* this process is a simliar in a fuckload number of other sites.

AND NO ONE HAS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS for christ sake.

### Supports (A whole lot more planned):
 - Google Search.com

qList uses [KeyboardJS](http://robertwhurst.github.io/KeyboardJS/) and the template was created using [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com)

How to Use
==========
Disable Instant. It sucks.
press f key and pick a number from 1-9.
press F key (with Shift) and pick a number for a new tab.

Try it out!

Install
====
Adding an extension to Chrome Store costs money. So I can't add the extension at the moment. To install:
- Download Crx from here.
- Disable Instant. It sucks. Also, not sure how the shortcuts would work with instant, so I just don't use it.
- Important: If you don't use google.com\co.il, switch to it, or you need to add your google.something to the manifest.json file, or just ask me to.
- Follow [instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?p=crx_warning&rd=1) here to install crx.
