## Pi6 - Search and lists keyboard shortcuts for the ADHD
Empower yourself with absolutely timesaving keyboard-shortcuts for search and lists with Pi6.

Pi6, P6, Pie 6 is an Extension for Chrome \ Chromium, soon for FireFox aswell.

Searching and navigating lists has never been this easy. Really. This is not just Apple-speak.
I knew I had to share this extension the moment I tried to use shortcuts for a site I haven't made shortcuts for, a site I never seen before and *got angry my extension didn't work*.

Curious to findout what I mean by that? install the extension and search something in google/youtube/many-more.

Also, Pi6 acts as a framework and enables adding new sites and shortcuts REALLY easy. If you want to add\suggest something, **dont'** hesitate to [contact me](364saga@gmail.com).

Promise I don't save any of your precious data.

## How to Use
