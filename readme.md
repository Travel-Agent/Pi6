Shucts
===========

Shucts is an extension for Chrome that adds keyboard-shortcuts to Google Search.
Using a key (default:x and c) and a number from 1-9, quickly open any link in Google Search, right from the keyboard! go to try it now!
you can even choose to open in the same tab (x) or in a new one! (c).

Shucts uses [KeyboardJS](http://robertwhurst.github.io/KeyboardJS/) and the template was created using [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com)
