## Pi6 - Search and lists keyboard shortcuts for the ADHD
Empower yourself with absolutely timesaving keyboard-shortcuts for search and lists with Pi6.
`
Pi6, P6, Pie 6 is an Extension for Chrome \ Chromium, soon for FireFox aswell.

Searching and navigating lists has never been this easy. Really. This is not just Apple-speak.
I knew I had to share this extension the moment I tried to use shortcuts for a site I haven't made shortcuts for, a site I never seen before and *got angry my extension didn't work*.

Curious to findout what I mean by that? install the extension and search something in google/youtube/many-more.

Also, Pi6 acts as a framework and enables adding new sites and shortcuts REALLY easy. If you want to add\suggest something, **dont'** hesitate to [contact me](364saga@gmail.com).

Promise I don't save any of your precious data.

## How to Use
 - Keys 1-9 opens in current tab.
 - Shift + 1-9 opens in new tab.
 - Key e focuses on the searchbox.
 - Shift+E does a "Select All" focus on the searchbox.
 - Keys j to go down, k to go up.

## Install
- [Download Crx from here](https://github.com/wildeyes/Pi6/raw/master/pi6.crx)
- [Disable Instant](https://www.google.com/search?q=disable+google+instant), which basically sums to click on the preferences on the top right\left (cog icon). (it's crap anyway)
- On windows, you may need to enable "Developers Mode" in the extensions page.
- Drag and drop the crx file to the Extensions page ([Guide to installing chrome extensions manually (not from chrome webstore)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+chrome+extensions+manually))

## Thanks
Mom you're great.

## I love making Pi6 using;
- [Chromix](https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix) gives me a CLI interface to Chrome (I refresh chrome tabs, and **the extenstion** directly from my text editor).
- [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) For dead easy keyboard binging.
- [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com) created Pi6 extension's template!
