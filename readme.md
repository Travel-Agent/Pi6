## qList - Awesome Broswer Shortcuts v1.1
Add keyboard-shortcuts to search pages and lists on pages.
Common scenario:
You need an answer to something. ALT-TAB to browser, CTRL-T opens a new tab,
You type something in the omnibar to google it...... AND you have to manually *mouse*-click on the links..

NO ONE SUPPORTS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS for christ sake.

### Supports (A whole lot more planned):
 - Google Search
 - Youtube Search
 - Cheatography Search
 - Israblog
 - ThePirateBay Search
 - ReadTheDocs Search

## How to Use
 - d opens first option in current tab.
 - f opens in current tab.
 - F opens in new tab.

## Install Methods
 - As a chrome extension.

## Install - Chrome extension
- [Download Crx from here](https://github.com/wildeyes/qList/raw/master/qList.crx).
- Go to this address : [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), and "drag" the crx file into that page (like it says in [Steps on adding extension from other websites at the bottom of the page](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?p=crx_warning&rd=1)). That should make a install-dialog pop up.
## Changelist
### v1.1
 - Keys j,k : scroll down and up.
 - New site support : ThePirateBay.
 - New site support : ReadTheDocs.
 - u : Open Extensions page ( I use it all the time!)
### v1
 - New site support : Cheatography.
 - New site support : Israblog.
 - New site support : Youtube.
 - Key d : select first option.
 - seperated data from system.
 - Enumeration after 9, until p (1-9, then q until p on the second row of the keyboard)

## TODO
- Customizable shortcuts through options page.
- Sublime Text 2 JS-Extension Build System
	- https://github.com/cgutierrez/JsMinifier
	- Script building from different files like described in [Fluent 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfoYaKCYUI)
- Selection status for F like / in Vimium.
- Support for every keyboard-scheme (e.g clicking the f while typing in russian\korean\arabic) 
- I'm feeling lucky right from the Omnibar! -> Actually can't be done in Chrome, considering switching to FF.
