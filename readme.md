## Install
- [Download Crx from here](https://github.com/wildeyes/qList/raw/master/qList.crx).
- Go to this address : [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), and "drag" the crx file into that page (like it says in [Steps on adding extension from other websites at the bottom of the page](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?p=crx_warning&rd=1)). That should make a install-dialog pop up.

## Changelist

### v1.12
 - Working CRX file (That stuff is important you know).
 - Youtube: r focuses on input. 
 - Extra keys.

### v1.1

## TODO
- Customizable shortcuts through options page.
- Sublime Text 2 JS-Extension Build System
    - https://github.com/cgutierrez/JsMinifier
    - Script building from different files like described in [Fluent 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfoYaKCYUI)
- Selection status for F like / in Vimium.
- Support for every keyboard-scheme (e.g clicking the f while typing in russian\korean\arabic) 
- I'm feeling lucky right from the Omnibar! -> Actually can't be done in Chrome, considering switching to FF.
