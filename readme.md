qList - Add Awesome Keyboard Shortcuts to Search
===========

qList adds keyboard-shortcuts to **to search engines**.
For example, googling is just searching something and going to another link.
BUT you have to manually *mouse*-click on the links..

AND NO ONE HAS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS for christ sake.

### Supports (A whole lot more planned):
 - Google Search
 - Youtube Search

How to Use
==========
Disable Instant. It sucks.
press f key and pick a number from 1-9.
press F key (with Shift) and pick a number for a new tab.

Try it out!

Install Methods
===============
 - As a chrome extension.
 - As a userscript.

Install - Chrome extension
====
Adding an extension to Chrome Store costs money. So I can't add the extension at the moment. To install:
- Download Crx from here.
- Go to chrome://extensions, and "drag" the crx-file into that page (like it says in [Steps on adding extension from other websites at the bottom of the page](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?p=crx_warning&rd=1)). That should make a install-dialog pop up.

Install - Greasemonkey\Tampermonkey Script
==========================================
- Download userscript.
- Install [the greasemonkey way](http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:Installing_Scripts) or [the Tampermonkey way](http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q102).

Question \ Complaint \ Encouragement?

TODO
====
- Customizable shortcuts through options page.
- Sublime Text 2 JS-Extension Build System
	- YUI JS Minify Build System (someday)
	- Script building from different files like described in [Fluent 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfoYaKCYUI)
