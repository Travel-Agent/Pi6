## qList - Awesome Search Shortcuts 2.0.2
Add keyboard-shortcuts to search pages and lists on pages.

### Supports (A whole lot more planned):
 - Google Search
 - Youtube Search
 - Cheatography Search
 - ThePirateBay Search
 - ReadTheDocs Search

## How to Use
 - 1-9 opens in current tab.
 - Shift + 1-9 opens in new tab.

## Install
- [Download Crx from here](https://github.com/wildeyes/qList/raw/master/qList.crx).
- Go to this address : [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), and "drag" the crx file into that page (like it says in [Steps on adding extension from other websites at the bottom of the page](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?p=crx_warning&rd=1)). That should make a install-dialog pop up.
