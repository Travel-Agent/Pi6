Pi6 is basically the processor for a file I like to call, *the rocket*. Since the data and the extension are decoupled, that enables adding Pi6 shortcuts to more new sites SUPER easy.
The rocket is a JS array of objects, each containing a single site (or group), take a look at it to get the idea of what's possible.
