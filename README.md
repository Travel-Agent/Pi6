## Pi6 : Search and lists keyboard shortcuts for the ADHD (Chrome Extension)
Empower yourself with absolutely timesaving keyboard-shortcuts for search and lists with Pi6.

Pi6, or by its other names such as P6 \ Pie 6 \ Pi 6 is an Extension for Chrome \ Chromium (soon for FireFox aswell) that extends your search pages and lists with a unified keyboard shortcut set. That means **no more typing something** into google and then **using the mouse**. It can all be done from the keyboard now.

Searching and navigating lists has never been this easy. Really. This is not just Apple-speak.
I knew I had to share this extension the moment I tried to use shortcuts for a site I haven't made shortcuts for, a site I never seen before and *got angry my extension didn't work*.

Curious to findout what I mean by that? install the extension and search something in google/youtube/many-more.

Also, Pi6 acts as a fgit ramework and enables adding new sites and shortcuts REALLY easy. If you want to add\suggest something, **dont'** hesitate to [contact me](364saga@gmail.com).

Promise I don't save any of your precious data.

## How to Use
- Keys 1-9 opens in current tab.
- Shift + 1-9 opens in new tab.
- Ctrl+Shift + 1-9 opens in new tab and **switches to it**.
- Key e focuses on the searchbox.
- Shift+E does a "Select All" focus on the searchbox.
- Keys j to go down, k to go up.

## Install (Very important! Follow carefully or won't work)
- [Download Crx from here](https://github.com/wildeyes/Pi6/raw/master/data/pi6.crx)
- [Disable Instant](https://www.google.com/search?q=disable+google+instant), which basically sums to click on the preferences on the top right\left (cog icon). (it's crap anyway)
- On windows, you may need to enable "Developers Mode" in the extensions page.
- Drag and drop the crx file to the Extensions page ([Guide to installing chrome extensions manually (not from chrome webstore)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+chrome+extensions+manually))
- **Important ProTip**: If an update requires addtional permissions, you will have to re-enable the extension manually. To do that, Click on the "bars" Icon and at the bottom click on "Pi6 Requires new permissions..." and re-enable.

## Thanks
Mom you're great.

## I love making Pi6 using;
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) which is so popular and needed, should be loaded automatically in browsers.
- [Chromix](https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix) gives me a CLI interface to Chrome (I refresh chrome tabs, and **the extenstion** directly from my text editor).
- [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) For dead easy keyboard binging.
- [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com) created Pi6 extension's template!
