## Pi6 Chrome Extension: Lists Keyboard shortcuts for the ADHD
**Save Time**, **Use Shortcuts**.

Pi6 (Also P6 \ Pie 6 \ Pi 6) provides keyboard shortcuts for * is an Extension for Chrome \ Chromium (soon for FireFox aswell) that extends your search pages and lists with a unified keyboard shortcut set. That means **no more typing something** into google and then **using the mouse**. It can all be done from the keyboard now.

Searching and navigating lists has never been this easy. Really. This is not just Apple-speak.
I knew I had to share this extension the moment I tried to use shortcuts for a site I haven't made shortcuts for, a site I never seen before and *got angry my extension didn't work*.

Curious to findout what I mean by that? install the extension and search something in google/youtube/many-more.

If you want to add\suggest something, **dont'** hesitate to [contact me](364saga@gmail.com).

Promise I don't save any of your precious data.
